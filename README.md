# datalogger

The main purpose of this datalogging project is to characterize Heavy Equipment Operations with data analysis.
The datalogger needs to gather data from multiple sources. 

This version is designed to work with :
- UBLOX NEO M8N - https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/neo-m8-series - EXTERNAL
- MPU6050 6DOF (Accelerometer & Gyroscope)
- HMC5883C - Magnetometer - EXTERNAL
- HCSSR04 - Ultrasonic Sensor

An external OLED display 0.96'' will be used to display data.
An SD recorder attached to the SPI bus will record data.

Data will be printed as TXT/CSV file
